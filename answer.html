      <h1>CYBERSECURITY RISKS OF AR</h1>

      <h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, particularly those involving facial
        filters, pose significant cybersecurity risks. While these applications
        enhance user experience, they also collect sensitive biometric data that
        can be exploited.
      </p>

      <h2>What Data is Collected?</h2>
      <p>
        AR applications often gather detailed facial measurements and features,
        which constitute sensitive biometric data. Users may not be fully aware
        of the extent of data being collected, leading to potential misuse.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Facial Recognition Data:</strong> This data can be exploited
          for identity theft or unauthorised access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manipulation Risks:</strong> Fake AR content can be injected
          to manipulate user perception and behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unauthorised Access:</strong> Vulnerabilities in AR
          applications could allow unauthorised access to camera feeds or other
          sensitive data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
      <p>
        As AR technologies become more integrated into our daily lives,
        understanding the implications for privacy and security is crucial.
        Users must critically assess the agreements they enter into when using
        AR filters and be aware of the potential risks to their digital lives.
